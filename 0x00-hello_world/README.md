# We start with the standard initiation, by writing a program that prints 'Hello, World'

## Description of each script
0. [`0-preprocessor`](https://github.com/AyomideA-S/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor) 	:	a script that runs a _C_ file through the *preprocessor* and save the result into another file `c`
1. [`1-compiler`](https://github.com/AyomideA-S/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler) 			:	a script that compiles a _C_ file but does not link (but with the extension `.o`)
2. [`2-assembler`](https://github.com/AyomideA-S/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler) 			:	a script that generates the _assembly_ code of a _C_ code and save it in an output file with the extension `.s`
3. [`3-name`](https://github.com/AyomideA-S/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/3-name) 					:	a script that compiles a _C_ file and creates an executable named `cisfun`
4. [`4-puts.c`](https://github.com/AyomideA-S/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c) 				:	a _C_ program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line
5. [`5-printf.c`](https://github.com/AyomideA-S/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c) 			:	a _C_ program that prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,`, followed by a new line
6. [`6-size.c`](https://github.com/AyomideA-S/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c) 				:	a _C_ program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on

## Advanced tasks
7. [`100-intel`](https://github.com/AyomideA-S/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/100-intel) 		:	a script that generates the _assembly_ code (*Intel syntax*) of a _C_ code and save it in an output file with the extension `.s`
8. [`101-quote.c`](https://github.com/AyomideA-S/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/101-quote.c) 	:	a _C_ program that prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line, to the **standard error**
